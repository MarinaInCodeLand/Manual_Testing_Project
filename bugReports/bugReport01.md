## Bug Tracking

- **Severity:** Minor  
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Assigned to:** *(not assigned)*  

## Improvement Suggestion

**Description:**  
Add visual indicators (like asterisks `*` or placeholder text) or labels to clearly mark the username and password input fields as mandatory during the login process.

**Rationale:**  
Currently, users are unaware that these fields are mandatory until they attempt to log in and receive an error notification. Adding visible mandatory field indicators will improve the user experience by reducing confusion, increasing efficiency, and prompting users to fill in the necessary information before clicking login.
